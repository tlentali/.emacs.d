# üöÄ Get inspired

This configuration was build and is still built thank to a lot of wise people (see the [Source](#source) section).  
This repo, on top of being a documented configuration for my future self, aims to inspire you through some amazings features delivered by emacs.  
I advise people not to use this configuration directly.  
Not because I don't like you to have my configuration. Some of my settings are host-specific and/or depend on path variables, emacs lisp files I did not add to the GitHub repository, or external tools.  

You should only adopt emacs lisp code you need and understand, to avoid [emacs bankruptcy](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy).  

Therefore: please feel free to look up certain tricks and functions and add it to your configuration. But don't use my repository as is and expect it to run on your host.
