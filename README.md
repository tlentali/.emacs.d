# Get inspired

This repo, on top of being a documented conf for my futur self, aims to get you inspired by some features delivered by emacs.  
I advise people not to use this configuration directly.  
Not because I don't like you to have my configuration. Some of my settings are host-specific and/or depend on path variables, Elisp files I did not add to the GitHub repository, or external tools.  

You should only adopt Elisp code you need and understand, to avoid [Emacs Bankruptcy](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DotEmacsBankruptcy).  

Therefore: please feel free to look up certain tricks and functions and add it to your configuration. But don't use my repository as is and expect it to run on your host.
